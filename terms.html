                                yourself. We are building an infrastructure for the new emerging economy based on
                                privately issued tokens backed with real people. We are aiming to build as robust and as
                                decentralized platform as possible. Our goal is to deliver as many tools as tokenized
                                people need and to make the token economy as cheap as we possibly can.</p><a
